An image processing project in C#

In second year of engineering school at ESILV
We were tasked with creating an object-oriented project in C# that would do image processing

We have several methods available :

Basic transformation
- Shade of girs
- Black and white
- Rescaling
- Rotation

Convolution filter
- Edge detection
- Pushback
- Reinforcement
- Gaussian blur
